## What I Learned
This app was my very first experience with Swift and Xcode. I wanted to take the initiative to learn Swift on my own personal time, so I started small to get familiar with the IDE and the technicalities of Swift. When I first started this project, I didn't have too much experience with GUIs, so it was interesting to see how outlets work.
